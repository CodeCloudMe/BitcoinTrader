Please refer to [their documentation](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/) for all calls explained. Check out `example.js` for a list of all possible calls and their parameters.\n\n    var Bitstamp = require('bitstamp');\n    var bitstamp = new Bitstamp;\n\n    bitstamp.transactions(function(err, trades) {\n      console.log(trades);  \n    });\n\n\n## 0.1.0 - Big October 2013 update\n\nThe whole private API authentication process looks different now. The result is that you have to provide different information to Bitstamp (generate an API key, provide key, secret and client ID - the last is your Bitstamp user ID). Check out the new examples in `example.js`.\n\n# Final\n\nIf this wrapper helped you in any way, you can always leave me a tip at (BTC) 1KyQdQ9ctjCrGjGRCWSBhPKcj5omy4gv5S\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Mike van Rossum mike@mvr.me\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
