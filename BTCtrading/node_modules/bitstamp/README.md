# Bitstamp

    npm install bitstamp

A basic API wrapper for the [Bitstamp REST API](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/). Please refer to [their documentation](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/) for all calls explained. Check out `example.js` for a list of all possible calls and their parameters.

    var Bitstamp = require('bitstamp');
    var bitstamp = new Bitstamp;

    bitstamp.transactions(function(err, trades) {
      console.log(trades);  
    });


## 0.1.0 - Big October 2013 update

The whole private API authentication process looks different now. The result is that you have to provide different information to Bitstamp (generate an API key, provide key, secret and client ID - the last is your Bitstamp user ID). Check out the new examples in `example.js`.
