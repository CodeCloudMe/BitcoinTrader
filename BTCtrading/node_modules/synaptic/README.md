Synaptic
========

Synaptic is a javascript neural network library for **node.js** and the **browser**, its generalized algorythm is architecture-free, so you can build and train basically any type of first order or even [second order neural network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network#Second_Order_Recurrent_Neural_Network) architectures.

This library includes a few built-in architectures like [multilayer perceptrons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron), [multilayer long-short term memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short_term_memory) networks (LSTM) or [liquid state machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_state_machine), and a trainer capable of training any given network, which includes built-in training tasks/tests like solving an XOR, completing a Distracted Sequence Recall task or an [Embeded Reber Grammar](http://www.willamette.edu/~gorr/classes/cs449/reber.html) test, so you can easily test and compare the performance of different architectures.


The algorythm implemented by this library has been taken from Derek D. Monner's paper:

[A generalized LSTM-like training algorithm for second-order recurrent neural networks](http://www.overcomplete.net/papers/nn2012.pdf)


There are references to the equations in that paper commented through the source code.

##Overview

###Installation

######In node
You can install synaptic with [npm](http://npmjs.org):

`npm install synaptic --save`

######In the browser
Just include the file synaptic.js (you can find it in the `/lib` directory) with a script tag in your HTML:

`<script src="synaptic.js"></script>`

###Usage

```
var synaptic = require('synaptic'); // this line is not needed in the browser
var Neuron = synaptic.Neuron,
	Layer = synaptic.Layer,
	Network = synaptic.Network,
	Trainer = synaptic.Trainer,
	Architect = synaptic.Architect;
```

Now you can start to create networks, train them, or use built-in networks from the [Architect](http://github.com/cazala/synaptic#architect).

###Demos

- [Solve an XOR](http://synaptic.juancazala.com/xor.html)
- [Discrete Sequence Recall Task](http://synaptic.juancazala.com/dsr.html)
- [Learn Image Filters](http://synaptic.juancazala.com/filter.html)
- [Paint an Image](http://synaptic.juancazala.com/paint.html)
- [Read from Wikipedia](http://synaptic.juancazala.com/wiki.html)

###Examples

######Perceptron

This is how you can create a simple [perceptron](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/predictor/network.jpg).

```
function Perceptron(input, hidden, output)
{
	// create the layers
	var inputLayer = new Layer(input);
	var hiddenLayer = new Layer(hidden);
	var outputLayer = new Layer(output);

	// connect the layers
	inputLayer.project(hiddenLayer);
	hiddenLayer.project(outputLayer);

	// set the layers
	this.set({
		input: inputLayer,
		hidden: [hiddenLayer],
		output: outputLayer
	});
}

// extend the prototype chain
Perceptron.prototype = new Network();
Perceptron.prototype.constructor = Perceptron;
```

Now you can test your new network by creating a trainer and teaching the perceptron to learn an XOR

```
var myPerceptron = new Perceptron(2,3,1);
var myTrainer = new Trainer(myPerceptron);

myTrainer.XOR(); // { error: 0.004998819355993572, iterations: 21871, time: 356 }

myPerceptron.activate([0,0]); // 0.0268581547421616
myPerceptron.activate([1,0]); // 0.9829673642853368
myPerceptron.activate([0,1]); // 0.9831714267395621
myPerceptron.activate([1,1]); // 0.02128894618097928
```

######Long Short-Term Memory

This is how you can create a simple [long short-term memory](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/lstmcell4.jpg) with input gate, forget gate, output gate, and peephole connections.

```
function LSTM(input, blocks, output)
{
	// create the layers
	var inputLayer = new Layer(input);
	var inputGate = new Layer(blocks);
	var forgetGate = new Layer(blocks);
	var memoryCell = new Layer(blocks);
	var outputGate = new Layer(blocks);
	var outputLayer = new Layer(output);

	// connections from input layer
	var input = inputLayer.project(memoryCell);
	inputLayer.project(inputGate);
	inputLayer.project(forgetGate);
	inputLayer.project(outputGate);

	// connections from memory cell
	var output = memoryCell.project(outputLayer);

	// self-connection
	var self = memoryCell.project(memoryCell, Layer.connectionType.ONE_TO_ONE);

	// peepholes
	memoryCell.project(inputGate,  Layer.connectionType.ONE_TO_ONE);
	memoryCell.project(forgetGate, Layer.connectionType.ONE_TO_ONE);
	memoryCell.project(outputGate, Layer.connectionType.ONE_TO_ONE);

	// gates
	inputGate.gate(input, Layer.gateType.INPUT);
	forgetGate.gate(self, Layer.gateType.ONE_TO_ONE);
	outputGate.gate(output, Layer.gateType.OUTPUT);

	// input to output direct connection
	inputLayer.project(outputLayer);

	// set the layers of the neural network
	this.set({
		input: inputLayer,
		hidden: hiddenLayers,
		output: outputLayer
	});
}

// extend the prototype chain
LSTM.prototype = new Network();
LSTM.prototype.constructor = LSTM;
```

These are examples for explanatory purposes, the [Architect](http://github.com/cazala/synaptic#architect) already includes Multilayer Perceptrons and
Multilayer LSTM networks architectures.


Documentation
=============

##Neuron

Neurons are the basic unit of the neural network. They can be connected together, or used to gate connetions between other neurons. 
A Neuron can perform basically 4 operations: project connections, gate connections, activate and propagate.

######project

A neuron can project a connection to another neuron (i.e. connect neuron A with neuron B).
Here is how it's done:

```
var A = new Neuron();
var B = new Neuron();
A.project(B); // A now projects a connection to B
```

Neurons can also self-connect:

`A.project(A);`

The method **project** returns a `Connection` object, that can be gated by another neuron.

######gate

A neuron can gate a connection between two neurons, or a neuron's self-connection. This allows you to create [second order neural network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network#Second_Order_Recurrent_Neural_Network) architectures.

```
var A = new Neuron();
var B = new Neuron();
var connection = A.project(B);

var C = new Neuron();
C.gate(connection); // now C gates the connection between A and B
```


######activate

When a neuron activates, it computes it's state from all its input connections and squashes it using its activation function, and returns the output (activation).
You can provide the activation as a parameter (useful for neurons in the input layer. it has to be a float between 0 and 1). For example:

```
var A = new Neuron();
var B = new Neuron();
A.project(B);

A.activate(0.5); // 0.5
B.activate(); // 0.3244554645
```


######propagate

After an activation, you can teach the neuron what should have been the correct output (a.k.a. train). This is done by backpropagating the error.
To use the **propagate** method you have to provide a learning rate, and a target value (float between 0 and 1).

For example, if I want to train neuron B to output a value close to 0 when neuron A activates a value of 1, with an error smaller than 0.005:

```
var A = new Neuron();
var B = new Neuron();
A.project(B);

var learningRate = .3,
	targetOutput = 0,
	error = 0.005,
	output = 1;

while(output - targetOutput > error)
{
	A.activate(1);

	output = B.activate();
	B.propagate(learningRate, targetOutput);
}

// test it
A.activate(1);
B.activate(); // 0.0049998578298219975
```

######squashing function and bias

By default, a neuron uses a [Logistic Sigmoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) as its squashing/activation function, and a random bias. 
You can change those properties the following way:

```
var A = new Neuron();
A.squash = Neuron.squash.TANH;
A.bias = 1;
```

There are 4 built-in squashing functions, but you can also create your own:

- [Neuron.squash.LOGISTIC](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SigmoidFunction.png)
- [Neuron.squash.TANH](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TanhFunction.jpg)
- [Neuron.squash.IDENTITY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Function-x.svg)
- [Neuron.squash.HLIM](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HardLimitFunction.png)

##Layer

Normally you won't work with single neurons, but use Layers instead. A layer is basically an array of neurons, they can do pretty much the same things as neurons do, but it makes the programming process faster.

To create a layer you just have to specify its size (the number of neurons in that layer).

`var myLayer = new Layer(5);`

######project

A layer can project a connection to another layer. You have to provide the layer that you want to connect to and the `connectionType`:

```
var A = new Layer(5);
var B = new Layer(3);
A.project(B, Layer.connectionType.ALL_TO_ALL); // All the neurons in layer A now project a connection to all the neurons in layer B
```

Layers can also self-connect:

`A.project(A, Layer.connectionType.ONE_TO_ONE);`

There are two `connectionType`'s:
- Layer.connectionType.ALL_TO_ALL
- Layer.connectionType.ONE_TO_ONE

If not specified, the connection type is always `Layer.connectionType.ALL_TO_ALL.`If you make a one-to-one connection, both layers must have **the same size**.

The method **project** returns a `LayerConnection` object, that can be gated by another layer.

######gate

A layer can gate a connection between two other layers, or a layers's self-connection.

```
var A = new Layer(5);
var B = new Layer(3);
var connection = A.project(B);

var C = new Layer(4);
C.gate(connection, Layer.gateType.INPUT_GATE); // now C gates the connection between A and B (input gate)
```

There are three `gateType`'s:
- Layer.gateType.INPUT_GATE: If layer C is gating connections between layer A and B, all the neurons from C gate all the input connections to B.
- Layer.gateType.OUTPUT_GATE: If layer C is gating connections between layer A and B, all the neurons from C gate all the output connections from A.
- Layer.gateType.ONE_TO_ONE: If layer C is gating connections between layer A and B, each neuron from C gates one connection from A to B. This is useful for gating self-connected layers. To use this kind of gateType, A, B and C must be the same size.

######activate

When a layer activates, it just activates all the neurons in that layer in order, and returns an array with the outputs. It accepts an array of activations as parameter (for input layers):

```
var A = new Layer(5);
var B = new Layer(3);
A.project(B);

A.activate([1,0,1,0,1]); // [1,0,1,0,1]
B.activate(); // [0.3280457, 0.83243247, 0.5320423]
```

######propagate

After an activation, you can teach the layer what should have been the correct output (a.k.a. train). This is done by backpropagating the error.
To use the **propagate** method you have to provide a learning rate, and a target value (array of floats between 0 and 1).

For example, if I want to train layer B to output [0,0] when layer A activates [1,0,1,0,1], with an error smaller than 0.005:

```
var A = new Layer(5);
var B = new Layer(2);
A.project(B);

var learningRate = .3,
	targetOutput = [0,0],
	error = 0.005
	output = [1,1];

while(output[0] - targetOutput[0] > error && output[1] - targetOutput[1] > error)
{
	A.activate([1,0,1,0,1]);

	output = B.activate();
	B.propagate(learningRate, targetOutput);
}

// test it
A.activate([1,0,1,0,1]);
B.activate(); // [0.004999850993267468, 0.00499980138183861]
```

######squashing function and bias

You can set the squashing function and bias of all the neurons in a layer by using the method **set**:

```
myLayer.set({
	squash: Neuron.squash.TANH,
	bias: 0
})
```

######neurons

The method `neurons()` return an array with all the neurons in the layer, in activation order.

##Network

Networks are basically an array of layers. They have an input layer, a number of hidden layers, and an output layer. Networks can project and gate connections, activate and propagate in the same fashion as [Layers](http://github.com/cazala/synaptic#layer) do. Networks can also be optimized, extended, exported to JSON, converted to Workers or standalone Functions, and cloned.

```
var inputLayer = new Layer(4);
var hiddenLayer = new Layer(6);
var outputLayer = new Layer(2);

inputLayer.project(hiddenLayer);
hiddenLayer.project(outputLayer);

var myNetwork = new Network({
	input: inputLayer,
	hidden: [hiddenLayer],
	output: outputLayer
});
```
######project

A network can project a connection to another, or gate a connection between two others networks in the same way [Layers](http://github.com/cazala/synaptic#layer) do.
You have to provide the network that you want to connect to and the `connectionType`:

```
myNetwork.project(otherNetwork, Layer.connectionType.ALL_TO_ALL); 
/* 	
	All the neurons in myNetwork's output layer now project a connection
	to all the neurons in otherNetowrk's input layer.
*/
```

There are two `connectionType`'s:
- Layer.connectionType.ALL_TO_ALL
- Layer.connectionType.ONE_TO_ONE

If not specified, the connection type is always `Layer.connectionType.ALL_TO_ALL.`If you make a one-to-one connection, both layers must have **the same size**.

The method **project** returns a `LayerConnection` object, that can be gated by another network or layer.

######gate

A Network can gate a connection between two other Networks or Layers, or a Layers's self-connection.

```
var connection = A.project(B);
C.gate(connection, Layer.gateType.INPUT_GATE); // now C's output layer gates the connection between A's output layer and B's input layer (input gate)
```

There are three `gateType`'s:
- Layer.gateType.INPUT_GATE: If netowork C is gating connections between network A and B, all the neurons from C's output layer gate all the input connections to B's input layer.

- Layer.gateType.OUTPUT_GATE: If network C is gating connections between network A and B, all the neurons from C's output layer gate all the output connections from A's output layer.

- Layer.gateType.ONE_TO_ONE: If network C is gating connections between network A and B, each neuron from C's output layer gates one connection from A's output layer to B's input layer. To use this kind of gateType, A's output layer, B's input layer and C's output layer must be the same size.

######activate

When a network is activeted, an input must be provided to activate the input layer, then all the hidden layers are activated in order, and finally the output layer is activated and its activation is returned.

```
var inputLayer = new Layer(4);
var hiddenLayer = new Layer(6);
var outputLayer = new Layer(2);

inputLayer.project(hiddenLayer);
hiddenLayer.project(outputLayer);

var myNetwork = new Network({
	input: inputLayer,
	hidden: [hiddenLayer],
	output: outputLayer
});

myNetwork.activate([1,0,1,0]); // [0.5200553602396137, 0.4792707231811006]
```

######propagate

You can provide a target value and a learning rate to a network and backpropagate the error from the output layer to all the hidden layers in reverse order until reaching the input layer. For example, this is how you train a network how to solve an XOR:

```
// create the network
var inputLayer = new Layer(2);
var hiddenLayer = new Layer(3);
var outputLayer = new Layer(1);

inputLayer.project(hiddenLayer);
hiddenLayer.project(outputLayer);

var myNetwork = new Network({
	input: inputLayer,
	hidden: [hiddenLayer],
	output: outputLayer
});

// train the network
var learningRate = .3;
for (var i = 0; i < 20000; i++)
{
	// 0,0 => 0
	myNetwork.activate([0,0]);
	myNetwork.propagate(learningRate, [0]);

	// 0,1 => 1
	myNetwork.activate([0,1]);
	myNetwork.propagate(learningRate, [1]);

	// 1,0 => 1
	myNetwork.activate([1,0]);
	myNetwork.propagate(learningRate, [1]);

	// 1,1 => 0
	myNetwork.activate([1,1]);
	myNetwork.propagate(learningRate, [0]);
}


// test the network
myNetwork.activate([0,0]); // [0.015020775950893527]
myNetwork.activate([0,1]); // [0.9815816381088985]
myNetwork.activate([1,0]); // [0.9871822457132193]
myNetwork.activate([1,1]); // [0.012950087641929467]
```

######optimize

Networks get optimized automatically on the fly after its first activation, if you print in the console the `activate` or `propagate` methods of your Network instance after activating it, it will look something like this:

```
function (input){
F[1] = input[0];
 F[2] = input[1];
 F[3] = input[2];
 F[4] = input[3];
 F[6] = F[7];
 F[7] = F[8];
 F[7] += F[1] * F[9];
 F[7] += F[2] * F[10];
 F[7] += F[3] * F[11];
 F[7] += F[4] * F[12];
 F[5] = (1 / (1 + Math.exp(-F[7])));
 F[13] = F[5] * (1 - F[5]);
 ...
 ```

This improves the performance of the network dramatically.

######extend

You can see how to extend a network in the [Examples](http://github.com/cazala/synaptic#examples) section.

######toJSON/fromJSON

Networks can be stored as JSON's and then restored back:

```
var exported = myNetwork.toJSON();
var imported = Network.fromJSON(exported);
```

######worker

The network can be converted into a WebWorker. This feature doesn't work in node.js, and it's not supported on every browser (it must support Blob).

```
// training set
var learningRate = .3;
var trainingSet = [
	{
		input: [0,0],
		output: [0]
	},
	{
		input: [0,1],
		output: [1]
	},
	{
		input: [1,0],
		output: [1]
	},
	{
		input: [1,1],
		output: [0]
	},
];

// create a network
var inputLayer = new Layer(2);
var hiddenLayer = new Layer(3);
var outputLayer = new Layer(1);

inputLayer.project(hiddenLayer);
hiddenLayer.project(outputLayer);

var myNetwork = new Network({
	input: inputLayer,
	hidden: [hiddenLayer],
	output: outputLayer
});

// create a worker
var myWorker = myNetwork.worker();

// activate the network
function activateWorker(input)
{
	myWorker.postMessage({ 
		action: "activate",
		input: input,
		memoryBuffer: myNetwork.optimized.memory
	}, [myNetwork.optimized.memory.buffer]);
}

// backpropagate the network
function propagateWorker(target){
	myWorker.postMessage({ 
		action: "propagate",
		target: target,
		rate: learningRate,
		memoryBuffer: myNetwork.optimized.memory
	}, [myNetwork.optimized.memory.buffer]);
}

// train the worker
myWorker.onmessage = function(e){
	// give control of the memory back to the network - this is mandatory!
	myNetwork.optimized.ownership(e.data.memoryBuffer);

	if (e.data.action == "propagate")
	{
		if (index >= 4)
		{
			index = 0;
			iterations++;
			if (iterations % 100 == 0)
			{
				var output00 = myNetwork.activate([0,0]);
				var output01 = myNetwork.activate([0,1]);
				var output10 = myNetwork.activate([1,0]);
				var output11 = myNetwork.activate([1,1]);

				console.log("0,0 => ", output00);
				console.log("0,1 => ", output01);
				console.log("1,0 => ", output10);
				console.log("1,1 => ", output11, "\n");
			}
		}

		activateWorker(trainingSet[index].input);
	}

	if (e.data.action == "activate")
	{
		propagateWorker(trainingSet[index].output);	
		index++;
	}
}

// kick it
var index = 0;
var iterations = 0;
activateWorker(trainingSet[index].input);
```

######standalone

The network can be exported to a single javascript Function. This can be useful when your network is already trained and you just need to use it, since the standalone functions is just one javascript function with an array and operations within, with no dependencies on Synaptic or any other library.

```
var inputLayer = new Layer(4);
var hiddenLayer = new Layer(6);
var outputLayer = new Layer(2);

inputLayer.project(hiddenLayer);
hiddenLayer.project(outputLayer);

var myNetwork = new Network({
	input: inputLayer,
	hidden: [hiddenLayer],
	output: outputLayer
});

var standalone = myNetwork.standalone();

myNetwork.activate([1,0,1,0]); 	// [0.5466397925108878, 0.5121246668637663]
standalone([1,0,1,0]);	 // [0.5466397925108878, 0.5121246668637663]
```

######clone

A network can be cloned to a completely new instance, with the same connections and traces.

```
var inputLayer = new Layer(4);
var hiddenLayer = new Layer(6);
var outputLayer = new Layer(2);

inputLayer.project(hiddenLayer);
hiddenLayer.project(outputLayer);

var myNetwork = new Network({
	input: inputLayer,
	hidden: [hiddenLayer],
	output: outputLayer
});

var clone = myNetwork.clone();

myNetwork.activate([1,0,1,0]); 	// [0.5466397925108878, 0.5121246668637663]
clone.activate([1,0,1,0]);	 // [0.5466397925108878, 0.5121246668637663]
```

######neurons

The method `neurons()` return an array with all the neurons in the network, in activation order.

######set

The method `set(layers)` receives an object with layers in the same format as the constructor of `Network` and sets them as the layers of the Network, this is useful when you are extending the `Network` class to create your own architectures. See the [examples](http://github.com/cazala/synaptic#examples) section.

```
var inputLayer = new Layer(4);
var hiddenLayer = new Layer(6);
var outputLayer = new Layer(2);

inputLayer.project(hiddenLayer);
hiddenLayer.project(outputLayer);

var myNetwork = new Network();

myNetwork.set({
	input: inputLayer,
	hidden: [hiddenLayer],
	output: outputLayer
});
```

##Trainer

The `Trainer` makes it easier to train any set to any network, no matter its architecture. To create a trainer you just have to provide a `Network` to train.

`var trainer = new Trainer(myNetwork);`

The trainer also contains bult-in tasks to test the performance of your network.

######train

This method allows you to train any training set to a `Network`, the training set must be an `Array` containing object with an **input** and **output** properties, for exmple, this is how you train an XOR to a network using a trainer:

```
var trainingSet = [
	{
		input: [0,0],
		output: [0]
	},
	{
		input: [0,1],
		output: [1]
	},
	{
		input: [1,0],
		output: [1]
	},
	{
		input: [1,1],
		output: [0]
	},
];

var trainer = new Trainer(myNetwork);
trainer.train(trainingSet);
```
You can also set different options for the training in an object as a second parameter, like:

trainer.train(trainingSet,{
	rate: .1,
	iterations: 20000,
	error: .005,
	shuffle: true,
	log: 1000
});

- **rate**: learning rate to train the network.
- **iterations**: maximum number of iterations
- **error**: minimum error
- **shuffle**: if true, the training set is shuffled after every iteration, this is useful for training data sequences which order is not meaningful to networks with context memory, like LSTM's.
- **log**: this commands the trainer to console.log the error and iterations every X number of iterations.
- **customLog**: you can create custom logs like this one:

```
customLog: {
	every: 500,
	do: function(error, iterations) {
		console.log("error", error, "iterations", iterations);
	}
}
```

When the training is done this method returns an object with the error, the iterations, and the elapsed time of the training.

######XOR

This method trains an XOR to the network, is useful when you are experimenting with different architectures and you want to test and compare their performances:

```
var trainer = new Trainer(myNetwork);
trainer.XOR(); // {error: 0.004999821588193305, iterations: 21333, time: 111}
```

######DSR

This method trains the network to complete a [Discrete Sequence Recall](http://synaptic.juancazala.com/dsr.html), which is a task for testing context memory in neural networks.

```
trainer.DSR({
	targets: [2,4],
	distractors: [3,5],
	prompts: [0,1],	
	length: 10	
});
```


######ERG

This method trains the network to pass an [Embeded Reber Grammar](http://www.willamette.edu/~gorr/classes/cs449/reber.html) test.

`trainer.ERG();`


##Architect

The Architect contains built-in architectures, ready to use.

######Perceptron

This architecture allows you to create multilayer perceptrons, also known as feed-forward neural networks. They consists on a sequence of layers, each fully connected to the next one. 

![multilayer perceptron](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/predictor/network.jpg "Multilayer Perceptron Architecture")

You have to provide a minimum of 3 layers (input, hidden and output), but you can use as many hidden layers as you wish. This is a `Perceptron` with 2 neurons in the input layer, 3 neurons in the hidden layer, and 1 neuron in the output layer:

`var myPerceptron = new Architect.Perceptron(2,3,1);`

And this is a deep multilayer perceptron with 2 neurons in the input layer, 4 hidden layers with 10 neurons each, and 1 neuron in the output layer

`var myPerceptron = new Architect.Perceptron(2, 10, 10, 10, 10, 1);`

######LSTM

The [long short-term memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short_term_memory) is an architecture well-suited to learn from experience to classify, process and predict time series when there are very long time lags of unknown size between important events.

![long short-term memory](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/lstmcell4.jpg "Long Short-Term Memory Architecture")

To use this architecture you have to set at least one input layer, one memory block assembly (consisting of four layers: input gate, memory cell, forget gate and output gate), and an output layer.

`var myLSTM = new Architect.LSTM(2,6,1);` 

Also you can set many layers of memory blocks:

`var myLSTM = new Architect.LSTM(2,4,4,4,1);` 

That LSTM network has three memory block assemblies, with 4 memory blocks each, and their own input gates, memory cells, forget gates and output gates.

######Liquid

The `Liquid` architecture allows you to create [Liquid State Machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_state_machine). In these networks, neurons are randomly connected to each other. The recurrent nature of the connections turns the time varying input into a spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network nodes.

To use this architecture you have to set the size of the input layer, the size of the pool, the size of the output layer, the number of random connections in the pool, and the number of random gates among the connections.

```
var input = 2;
var pool = 20;
var output = 1;
var connections = 30;
var gates = 10;

var myLiquidStateMachine = new Architect.Liquid(input, pool, output, connections, gates);
```

You can create your own architectures by extending the `Network` class. You can check the [Examples](http://github.com/cazala/synaptic#examples) section for more information about this.
