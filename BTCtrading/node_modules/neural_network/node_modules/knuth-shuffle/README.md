The Fisher-Yates (Knuth) Shuffle
===

As Microsoft learned the hard way (see article below), `function random() { return 0.5 - Math.random() }` turns out to be no-so-random at all.

The fisher-yates shuffle is an algorithm so simple that even
[IEEE floating point math](http://blogs.adobe.com/bparadie/2011/11/22/0-2-0-1-0-30000000000000004/)
can't screw it up!

I put this on npm as `knuth-shuffle` because `fisher-yates-shuffle`
was just too long of a name and shuffle was already taken.

Browser Example
===

```html
<script src="https://raw.github.com/coolaj86/knuth-shuffle/master/index.js"></script>
```

```javascript
(function () {
  'use strict';

  var a = [2,11,37,42]
    , b
    ;

  // The shuffle modifies the original array
  // calling a.slice(0) creates a copy, which is assigned to b
  b = window.knuthShuffle(a.slice(0));
  console.log(b);
}());
```

Node Example
===

```bash
npm install -S knuth-shuffle
```

```javascript
(function () {
  'use strict';

  var shuffle = require('knuth-shuffle').knuthShuffle
    , a = [2,11,37,42]
    , b
    ;

  // The shuffle modifies the original array
  // calling a.slice(0) creates a copy, which is assigned to b
  b = shuffle(a.slice(0));
  console.log(b);
}());
```
